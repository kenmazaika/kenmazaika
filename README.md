# Hello!  :wave:

My name is Ken.  Great to meet you!

I'm [CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenmazaika/) at [Hello Metropolis](http://hellometropolis.com/).  We're a DevOps platform that helps engineering teams build software faster.

Before that, I was Director of Engineering at _Trilogy Education_, which acquired the company I co-founded _Firehose Project_, where I was the CTO.

As well as building people and technology, I enjoy writing.

I'm on Twitter ([@kenmazaika](https://www.twitter.com/kenmazaika)) if you'd like to chat.
